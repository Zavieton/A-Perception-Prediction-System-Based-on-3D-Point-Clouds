### PPS3D: A Perception-Prediction System Based on 3D Point Clouds
#### Abstract: Perceiving the obstacles and predicting their trajectories play an important role in ensuring the safety of the robots. Recently years, some related methods have made great progress, but these methods are lack flexibility and lack real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes a novelty, real-time, and flexibility Perception-Prediction system to perceive the obstacle and predict trajectories based on 3D point clouds. The system proposed is modularized so it has strong flexibility and renewability. This paper studies recent relative 3D detection method and proposed a stragety to create a trajectories data set from raw point clouds data. To fix the problem of lack flexibility, this paper proposes the methods of modular design to build five replaceable functional modules to ensure the flexibility of the system. A compensation mechanism is proposed to improve the robustness of connection between modules. This paper also proposes a frame stabilization module which uses some numerical methods such as spline interpolation and Gaussian filtering are proposed to improve the robustness of trajectories prediction module. The experimental results are evaluated on the KITTI data set. The results show that the system can achieve a good performance on predicting trajectories based on point clouds and it can run at around 20Hz on which can prove the real-time performance of our system.
